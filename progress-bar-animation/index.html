      <h1>The One Book I Wish I Read Earlier</h1>
      <p>
        When you read regularly you come across a wide variety of books. A
        majority of the time the books that you read are impactful in the
        moment, but lose their potency as you move onto other books. However,
        occasionally you do come across a book that permeates through this
        barrier and stays with you.
      </p>
      <p>
        The one book that had this impact on me was ‘12 Rules For Life’ by
        Jordan B. Peterson. Although he is a controversial figure in the
        political arena, the book holds a lot of value. As a follow-up to his
        first book ‘Maps of Meaning’, which is by far the most complicated piece
        of writing I have ever read. ‘12 Rules For Life’ sets out a framework
        for individuals to cultivate better self-awareness in order to live a
        better life.
      </p>
      <p>
        Self-awareness is the key theme of the book. To look inwards and analyse
        the structure of your life to find what needs to be changed is a painful
        exercise. At times you are questioning every single habit or activity in
        order to assess whether it holds any value for long-term success. This
        is neither easy nor a quick process and requires time and diligent
        effort to see its rewards. What is evident is that this process, if done
        right, can lead to significant improvements in understanding who you
        actually are.
      </p>
      <p>
        Rule 6 in the book, “Set your house in perfect order before you
        criticise the world” is a perfect assessment of this fact. When we are
        readily questioning the structures that govern us, however well
        intentioned, we are systematically not fixing the core issue. Individual
        sovereignty is the foundation of a democratic society, therefore it is
        up-to the individual to ensure that they are taking responsibility for
        their life.
      </p>
      <p>
        When we are looking to Governments and Multi-National organisations to
        fix some of the worlds growing problems, it is important to also ask
        ourselves what we can do to fix the problem. This starts in the home and
        then permeates throughout society leading to more widespread change.
        Instead of blame for the system, it is aid in help of the system. The
        principles seem simplistic in their thought but difficult in their
        application.
      </p>
      <p>
        As we look to find ways to improve the systems that govern us both
        individually and in society as a whole, individual accountability and
        sovereignty must be placed in the highest regard. A book such as ‘12
        Rules For Life’ will help with this difficult exercise.
